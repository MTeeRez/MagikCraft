# Installing Magikcraft

## On your own server

- Copy `magik-scriptcraft.jar` to your server's `plugins` directory. Remove the `scriptcraft.jar` plugin if you have that installed already - they will clash.
- Copy `scriptcraft` and `scriptcraft-plugins` directories into your server root directory, next to `plugins`.
